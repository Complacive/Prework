            Hello, fellow iX'ers! Welcome to my personal page! To start things off, my name is Chun Lu. I am from 
            Yorktown, Virginia in the United States. I am a rising Third-Year student at the 
            University of Virginia studying at the McIntire School of Commerce, as well as majoring 
            in Computer Science. This summer, I am taking Full Stack Coding at iXperience in Cape
            Town in order to gain more exposure to formal software development, as most of my classes
            will compose of soley Commerce classes in my Third-Year at UVa. My GitHub username is 
            Complacive, so feel free to reach out!

        <div class = "word2">
            In my free time, I enjoy all sorts of outdoor activities. My favorite activity is hiking 
            and photography, and Cape Town has provided me an excellent opportunity to do just that! 
            In addition, I love to stay active through activities such as playing basketball and working out. 
            On occassions, I enjoy flying bi-planes at UVa. My friends and I take trips across 
            the state of Virginia during our school-year weekends, and its definitely a surreal experience 
            to say the least! I look forward to working with my peers and mentors over the course
            of this summer for a great experience in Cape Town!
